   - added klist single-value failure
   - split up nostrict into nostrict_single and nostrict_match
   - added a CQ export "constant" for convenience, not documented
     until I see if I like it.

     they're described well (last entry in the CUTE QURIES item
     list)

   - Another patch from Hans. C<< >> won't escape an L<> inside?
     Huh.

   - added scalar query sub-types: xml() twig() recurse_text()
   - removed the recurse_text=>1 option -- affects entire query,
     should be per match
   - fixed a few uninitialized values warnings for nostrict=>1 queries.
